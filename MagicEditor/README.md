Fork off the [SOCVR Magic Editor](https://github.com/SO-Close-Vote-Reviewers/UserScripts/blob/master/Magic%E2%84%A2Editor.user.js) (under the MIT license). 

This fork intends to add URL replacement abilities, for either single URLs or on even bigger scales where URLs are either broken, disallowed, or otherwise need to be changed. 

Note that this only handles regex, and adds support to customize URL replacements - it does NOT cover all the URLs that need to be replaced.
