# Installation 

Get a userscript manager (i.e. TamperMonkey or ViolentMonkey, or any other for that matter. Compatibility isn't guaranteed), then click [here](https://github.com/LunarWatcher/userscripts/raw/master/HiggsReviewEnhancer/ReviewEnhancer.user.js) 

# Usage

Incredibly simple: 

Go to [review](https://higgs.sobotics.org/review) (log in if necessary). 

Keybinds:

* f - fp
* n - nc
* s - sk
* t / k - tp

Clicking any of those keys highlights the corresponding button. `fn` isn't mapped as I haven't seen any current use of it. Clicking enter sends the feedback
